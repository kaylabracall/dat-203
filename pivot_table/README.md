## Inquiry 1

What patterns exist in the gender of the respondent and their perception of Hazelwood's physical appearance? Are folks more likely to be willing to volunteer for a block watch if they believe the neighborhood's appearance is positive?

A higher percentage of female respondents than male respondents rated the neighborhood "Good." A higher percentage of male respondents than male respondents rated the neighborhood "Poor."

For respondents that rated the neighborhood appearance "Excellent" 68.75% would participate in a block watch group. However, the second most likely group to participate in a block watch group were those that rated the neighborhood appearance "Poor."

## Bonus Inquiry

I also decided I wanted to look at my own inquiry. I sliced the question "All things considered, how satisfied would you say you are with life in the neighborhood these days?" by gender. My theory was that female respondents may respond more favorably and give higher scores. The question was answered using a 0-10 scale. 

I looked at the scores both grand total (i.e. of the respondents that answered, how many scored the neighborhood a 10, etc.) and by gender (i.e. of the males that responded, how many scored the neighborhood a 10). 

As expected, female respondents generally rated the neighborhood slightly more favorably.

- Of the total respondents, 19.78% of female respondents rated the neighborhood a 10, per the below graphic. Only 8.21% of male respondents rated the neighborhood a 10.

However, we need to keep in mind that over 69% of the respondents were female. We can look further into responses by breaking down response by gender. 

-28.53% of female respondents rated the neighborhood a 10, as compared to 26.8% of male respondents
- For female respondents, the most common rating was a 10, with 8 being the second most common
- For male respondents, the most common rating was a 10, with 7 being the second most common
