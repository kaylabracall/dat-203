## Pivot Table 1

The first inquity I wanted to look at was "All things considered, how satisfied would you say you are with life in the neighborhood these days?" by gender. My theory is that female respondents may respond more favorably and give higher scores. The question was answered using a 0-10 scale. 

I looked at the scores both grand total (i.e. of the respondents that answered, how many scored the neighborhood a 10, etc.) and by gender (i.e. of the males that responded, how many scored the neighborhood a 10)
